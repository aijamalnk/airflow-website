# The Apache Airflow Project

## History

Airflow was started in October 2014 by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb. It was open source from the very first commit and officially brought under the Airbnb Github and announced in June 2015.

The project joined the Apache Software Foundationâ€™s incubation program in March 2016, and [graduated from it on January 2019](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces44).
