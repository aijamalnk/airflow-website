# Apache Airflow Website

Authors: [Aizhamal Nurmamat kyzy](http://github.com/aijamalnk), [Pablo Estrada](http://github.com/pabloem).

This is a prototype for a website for the Apache Airflow project. It's based
on the template used for [Apache Beam](http://beam.apache.org).

The website supports easily adding new pages, and editing with Markdown.
When it comes to the documentation, the proposal is that pydocs will remain
to be written in Sphinx, and built with ReadTheDocs.

To try, build and test the website locally, try the provided scripts: `build_site.sh`, `serve_site.sh`, and `test_site.sh`.
